Here are some ideas for the Mamba app's home screen UI, following your project vision and best practices:

1. Modern, Clean Layout:

- Use a sidebar for navigation (consistent with the rest of the app).
- Top navbar for quick actions, user profile, and notifications.
- Main content area with a welcoming message and quick access to core features.

2. Personalized Welcome:

- Show a greeting with the user’s name and avatar.
- Display a summary of recent activity or suggestions (e.g., “What would you like to do today?”).

3. Quick Actions & Shortcuts:

- Prominent buttons or cards for the most common tasks (e.g., “Create Task”, “Open Assistant”, “Recent Files”).
- Option to customize shortcuts.

4. Smart Assistant Panel:

- Integrate a visible, easily accessible panel or button to invoke Mamba’s assistant.
- Show tips, recent suggestions, or context-aware actions.

5. Productivity Widgets:

- Mini-widgets for calendar, to-dos, or notifications.
- Option to rearrange or hide widgets for personalization.

6. Visual Appeal:

- Use shadcn/ui and Radix UI for consistent, accessible components.
- Subtle background patterns or gradients (e.g., hexagon background from your assets).
- Animations for transitions and feedback (e.g., typing effect, progress bars).

7. Accessibility & Responsiveness:

- Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- Responsive layout for different window sizes.

8. Internationalization:

- All texts use i18n keys, supporting both English and Spanish.
